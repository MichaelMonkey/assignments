One time while browsing the web on his computer Brandon got an email that there was an udpate for YouTube.
When he opened the email and clicked the link, it open a fake version of the YouTube website and asks for his account info.
When he entered in his information it closed the link and sent his information to the phispher, Michael.
Michael phished him because he was mad at Brandon for stealing his potatoes. He was never caught and now Brandon can't use YouTube.
